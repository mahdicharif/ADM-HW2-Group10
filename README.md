# ADM-HW2-Group10
This repository gathers all the files of group 10.

In this folder, you will find :

- A jupyter file, containing the answers to all the questions. It is named **main.ipynb**.
- Maps on the two core questions. Since we cannot add them on the Jupyter file, we exported them and put them in this repositery. This file is **theory.ipynb.

### NB : For some technical reasons, we used a modified version of a dataset for RQ4 and RQ5.
